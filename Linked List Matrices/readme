implement a complete linked list system to perform arithmetic on sparse matrices using our linked list representation
(a) mread: Read in a sparse matrix
(b) mwrite: Write out the contents of a sparse matrix
(c) madd: Create the sparse matrix d=a+b
(d) mmult: Create the sparse matrix d=a*b
(e) mtranspose: Create the sparse matrix b=aT

The content of the input sparse matrix will be written in the input file, read the input file to get the content.
If user choose “Add Matrices” or “Multi Matrices”, then read two input files.
The input file for “Add Matrices” should be named as “add1_matrix.txt” and “add2_matrix.txt”.
The input file for “Multi Matrices” will be “multi1_matrix.txt” and “multi2_matrix.txt”. 
For “Transpose Matrix”, read an input file “transpos_matrix.txt”.

A .txt file contains the content of a sparse matrix.
In the .txt file, the first line contains three values (m,n,t) which represents row, column, and the number of the nonzero values,
follow by all the nonzero values in the sparse matrix with their respective row, column and values.

Show the output directly on the screen. The output file should be the same format as the input file.
