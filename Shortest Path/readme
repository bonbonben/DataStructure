The source node is fixed to node 0.
The program should be able to input different destination nodes.
For each destination nodes output the source destination shortest path length and the node number of this path.
Design a continuous function to input, terminate your program until you input -1.

Example Input:
Input node number as destination
Input node 3

Example Output:
The shortest path length from node 0 to node 3 is 19
The path is 0->2->3
